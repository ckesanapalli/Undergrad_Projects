Implementation of level-set method for solution of bubble in a cavity:

The solution algorithm for the Navier-Stokes equations utilizes an explicit scheme for pressure
and an implicit scheme for velocities, i.e., the velocity field at a new time step can be computed
once the corresponding pressure is known.
